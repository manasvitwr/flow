# Flow

**Built for timeblocking.**

Time just disappears when you're juggling too much. Flow is a visual timer and task manager that lets you assign time blocks to your tasks and actually see your day play out on a timeline. No fluff, no overcomplicated features—just a clean way to organize your time and get stuff done.

## Features

- **Visual timeline** — Your entire day on one screen, not scattered across lists
- **Task timers** — Set a timer for each task, watch it count down
- **Timeblocking built-in** — Assign chunks of time to specific tasks and stick to them
- **Retro UI** — Optional themes that don't look like every other productivity tool
- **Bookmarks** — Flag important blocks so you don't lose track

## Why timeblocking?

If you've never tried it, timeblocking is simple: instead of making endless to-do lists, you assign specific time slots to each task. It forces you to be realistic about how long things take, keeps you focused on one thing at a time, and prevents that "where did my day go" feeling.

Flow makes this dead simple—just add a task, set a timer, and let it run. No overthinking, no setup paralysis.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

That's it.

## Getting Started

Clone it and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manasvitwr/flow.git
cd flow
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and you're in.

## Disclaimer

The current tech stack (React + Vite) makes the initial load a bit slower than I'd like. I'm working on optimizing this—probably migrating to a lighter setup or doing some lazy loading magic. For now, it works fine once it's loaded, but don't expect instant startup times.

Also, this is still being actively developed. Bugs exist. Features are being added. If something breaks, feel free to open an issue.
